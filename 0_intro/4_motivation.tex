\begin{frame}[t]{Long-Standing Needs in PRA Quantification}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Large-scale PRA models ($\geq\space\approx10^4$ components) remain computationally taxing.
    \item To ease burden, approximations are used, implicating accuracy.
    \item No knobs for controlling trade-off between accuracy and speed.
  \end{itemize}
